what are commands?
A command is an instruction given to our computer by us whatever we want..In Mac os and Linux it is called "terminal" and in windows it is called "command prompt".Commands are always case-sensitive.

Commands are executed in at the commandline followed by pressing the enter key..This command further passes to the shell which reads the command and executes it..
* Shell is a method for the user to interact with the system.....
